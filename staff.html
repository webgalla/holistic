<br>Certified Pilates Instructor
<br>Black Belt in Karate, CMAC
<br>Black Belt in Kobudo, CMAC
<br>Tai Chi Certification, CMAC</em>
<br>
<br>Yvonne lives Yoga and Pilates every day. She has cultivated a commitment both through her practice and meditation. She started out in the Martial Arts receiving black belts in Karate, Kobudo, and Tai Chi. Shortly after, she received her teacher’s certificate for teaching Yoga and Pilates.  She sees the body as energy and having explored the element of energetic flow understands the benefits of reenergizing our bodies.  As we create lines of energy through the body, we also create space through the joints and spine and as our bodies open, our minds begin to open.  She understands that balance comes from a calm and focused mind.
<br>
<br>She teaches a hatha flow yoga class where the mind, body and breathe are connected, moving from one move to the next with mindfulness and breath.  She also teaches a vigorous Pilates class for a whole body workout .

Born with a Sagittarius Sun (the sign of the Philosopher) and a Gemini Moon (the sign of the curious teacher), Tracy’s love of practicing yoga ultimately led her to complete her teacher training with Holistic Bodyworx.
<br>
<br>Her classes focus on integrating breath, movement, meditation &amp; philosophy to engage students in creating and nurturing the space between their thoughts, feelings and actions to find what yoga means in their daily lives.

<br>Certified Practitioner of Thai Massage - Still Light Centre - Toronto</em>
<br>
<br>Tony first stumbled across Yoga during his early working life when he found himself taking “Kundalini Yoga” classes as an outlet to the everyday stresses of work life.   During this time he realized that there was truly something transformational  about yoga, which always left him feeling internally balanced, strengthened and at peace, after participating in a class.   Many years later, he found himself establishing a weekly practice by participating in “yoga” classes at a local gym.  To deepen and expand his interest in Yoga, Tony decided to pursue the Yoga Teacher Training through Holistic Bodyworx. <br><br> Since then, he has been teaching at various studios in both heated and non-heated environments.  Throughout his classes, Tony strives to teach yoga with a specific focus on postural alignment, breathing and relaxation techniques that will allow participants to become stronger, more balanced and relaxed.  “For me, there is no greater investment in one’s physical, mental and spiritual health than through the practice of Yoga except being able to teach and guide others where I truly feel privileged and honoured to have the opportunity to do so".<br></p>

With a positive mind &amp; drive to get back to fitness &amp; dance, Shanna recovered &amp; danced for another year. However, her flexibility was lost &amp; stiffness in the legs were apparent. Shanna knew she had to let go of dance &amp; move into a new passion. 
<br><br>After a couple years of gyms &amp; spin classes, Shanna discovered Pilates and started working at Holistic Body Worx in early 2009. Not only with a 10 year life in Pilates, but also doing personal training to ensure that her Scoliosis would never give her an issue.

<br>Certified Energy Healing Programme By Dalida Iruoha,Medical Intuitive&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></em>
<br>Satya is an Intuitive Energy Healer and Yoga Teacher.  She is compassionate, loving, supportive, and honest.  She is connected with the spirit realm and offers a safe and sacred space for you to open up and to heal.  The healing services and classes she offers include: yoga, meditation, sound healing, energy healing, and intuitive counselling. 
<br>
<br>A “truth-seeker”, Satya is driven to unravel only truth.  She wanted to know the origin of yoga and the true meaning of this ancient practise.  A couple years later, she studied to become a yoga teacher under the traditional teachings of Sivananda Yoga in an ashram at Woodbourne, NY.  Undergoing profound experiences on this mountain, Satya was determined to share this knowledge with the world.  At the end of her teacher training, her gurus meditated upon her the spiritual name “Satya”, which means “truth” in Sanskrit. &nbsp;She incorporated tai chi basics in her meditations to learn how to feel energy.
<br>
<br>Over the years, Satya created her own style of yoga and called it “Yoga Chi”.  It combines all of her healing skills in one — yoga, meditation/mindfulness, and energy healing. Energy Healing is a healing modality that Satya intuitively connected with throughout her awakened spiritual path.  She took a course on Energy Healing with her mentor Dalida Iruoha (Medical Intuitive) which has increased her knowledge, awareness, skills, and sensitivity as an Empath and Intuitive Healer. 
<br>
<br>“I have a calling to use my intuitive healing gifts to help oneself to bring awareness of the self.”
